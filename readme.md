### Project Specs
#### `JavaScript` basics
`JavaScript` coding syntax and constructs were demonstrated and discussed, including:
- declared and assigned values to `planets` object array, which included an image file for each planet
- `css` styling, including `.btn:hover`, which changes the appearance of the `Show Me Planets` button upon a mouse hover
- built the entire string of Planets, then wrote to the DOM
- all Planets are initialized with `class="planetName hidden"`; when user clicks on a Planet element, the `hidden` class is removed, and value for `planets[i].name` displays in white on the Planet image.


### Technologies Used
- `html`
